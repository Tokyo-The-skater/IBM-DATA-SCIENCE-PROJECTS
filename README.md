## Project Structure

- `data/` : Contains the datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and modeling.
- `scripts/` : Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `results/` : Outputs and visualizations generated by the analysis.

## Data Collection

The data for this project was sourced from various public datasets and includes information relevant to the specific analysis tasks. Details of the data sources and collection methods can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Data Wrangling

Data wrangling involved cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This included handling missing values, normalizing data, and transforming variables as needed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns and distributions within the data. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing data distributions, and identifying correlations between variables.

## Predictive Analysis

Machine learning models were developed to predict outcomes based on the data. Techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering were applied to uncover insights and make predictions.

## Results

The results of the analysis showed that we were able to predict car prices, classify flower types with high accuracy, and analyze unemployment trends in India. Visualizations and detailed findings are documented in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the application of data science techniques to real-world datasets, yielding valuable insights and predictions.
